        "### **What are Activation Functions?**\n",
        "Think of an activation function as a decision-maker inside a neuron. In our brains, a neuron only \"fires\" (sends a signal) if the combined input signals it receives are strong enough.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a neural network, the activation function does the same thing. It takes the output of a neuron and decides whether that signal is important enough to be passed on to the next layer. This is how the network learns to make complex, non-linear decisions. Without activation functions, a neural network is just a bunch of simple multiplications and additions, making it useless for solving anything but the simplest problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Our Example:** Deciding if it will Rain\n",
        "Let's imagine a neural network that predicts if it will rain based on humidity and temperature.\n",
        "\n",
        "Humidity: 80%\n",
        "\n",
        "Temperature: 20°C\n",
        "\n",
        "The neuron takes these two numbers, multiplies them by some learned \"weights,\" and adds them up. Let's say the result is 3.5. This number, 3.5, is the input to our activation function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's see how different activation functions decide what to do with this 3.5.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**\n",
        "The ReLU function is like a simple switch.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rule:** If the input is positive, let it pass through as is. If it's zero or negative, stop the signal completely (output 0).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Our Example:** Our input is 3.5, which is positive. So, ReLU outputs 3.5.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Decision:** \"The signal is strong, pass it on!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Sigmoid**\n",
        "The Sigmoid function is like a probability dial. It squishes any number into a value between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rule:** It takes any number and turns it into a decimal between 0 and 1. A number like -10 becomes close to 0, and a number like +10 becomes close to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Our Example:** Our input is 3.5. The Sigmoid function turns this into a number around 0.97.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Decision:** \"This is a very strong signal. It's almost certain (0.97) that we should predict 'Yes, it will rain!'\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**\n",
        "The Tanh function is similar to Sigmoid but outputs a value between -1 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rule:** It takes any number and converts it to a value between -1 and 1. Positive numbers move towards 1, and negative numbers move towards -1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Our Example:** Our input is 3.5. The Tanh function turns this into a number around 0.99.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Decision:** \"This is a very strong positive signal, indicating a strong 'Yes'.\" The negative outputs could indicate a strong 'No'.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. SiLU (Sigmoid Linear Unit)**\n",
        "SiLU is a newer, smoother function.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rule:** It's a bit more complex. It's the input number multiplied by its own Sigmoid.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Our Example:** Our input is 3.5. SiLU multiplies 3.5 by sigmoid(3.5), which is roughly 0.97. The result is about 3.4.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Decision:** \"The signal is strong, and this function allows for a more subtle, nuanced pass-through of information.\" This smoothness can help deep networks train more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Leaky ReLU (Leaky Rectified Linear Unit)**\n",
        "The Leaky ReLU function is like a switch that's never fully off. It lets a small amount of signal through, even if it's negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rule:** If the input is positive, let it pass through as is. If the input is zero or negative, let a small fraction of the signal pass through instead of stopping it completely.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Our Example:** If our input is -2, ReLU would output 0. Leaky ReLU would output a small value, like -0.02 (assuming a 'leak' rate of 0.01).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Decision:** \"The signal is negative, but we'll let a little bit of information pass through anyway.\""
